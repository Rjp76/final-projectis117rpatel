<p>Durarara takes place in Tokyo, Japan, mostly surrounding the Ikebukuro district. The series follows Celty Sturluson and her adventure for her missing head, which seems to be in the city. Celty is a dullahan, which is, by Irish folklore, a headless horsemen who comes to reap the souls of the dead.
While the series is about her, it shines huge lights on other members of the cast. Three high schoolers whose friendship are at odds with the current state of the gang wars, information brokers meddling where they don’t belong, a guy in a bartender suit that’s trying to stop said information broker, gangs, yakuza, pharmaceutical companies and the supernatural all come to play in Ikebukuro.</p>
<br>
<p>A series that jumps around a lot, but makes a lot of sense in the end, it has slow beginnings, but as the series goes on, things get more exciting. Both the art and the author get better at their craft. Narita is witty with his words, and knows how to balance between serious and lightheartedly funny scenes, and is able to make them feel natural. </p>
<br>
<p>The series started with the light novel, back in April of 2004, with the release of the book <i>‘Durarara!! x1’</i>. The stream of novels continued (ranging from Durarara!! to other series, such as Baccano!), and on December 26th, 2009, the first manga for the series came out, followed shortly of the first aired episode of the Durarara!! Anime on Janurary 2010.
The anime ended in June, and while novels and the other manga were slowly coming out, it wasn’t until five years later that a second arc of the anime was released, with the Durarara!! Series coming to a close, and it’s “sequel” Durarara!! SH just starting. So on Janurary 10th, 2015, the second round of the anime Durarara!! X2 Shou started. In July of that same year, Durarara!! X2 Ten started, and the final ‘cour’ started on Janurary 9th, 2016. The Durarara!! x2 Manga came out some time after the second cour. And, on July 21st, theofficial  English release of the light novels came out on July 21st, 2015, and are, at the time of writing this, still coming out. </p>
